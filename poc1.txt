Not sure who my 5 will be. Guess we shall see. Sometimes you just need a friend. 
I have felt this lately...These are very difficult times we live in. 
Doing a friend's check-in. Showing support for each other. 
I want five people to post this message, (don't share), 
to show that you're always there when someone needs to talk.
Say Done when done.
Who are my 5?
Ok I need the motivation to study
This law chat is starting to sound more like a cult than a study group, like wtf.
How can you be semi-perfect? You're either perfect or you're not me. There's no grey area.
I feel broken inside and really guilty with my fiance.
can i join the law chat pls?
It's weird, I've been fine through all this lock down and restrictions but I'm really starting to feel numb from all this.
This mid-sem break is really gonna be something.
Yes we can always be more careful, but to leave the chat like that is disappointing.
Im a bit unsure about the long term effects of mRNA technology
Whats meant to be will be.
The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.
Time heals everything.
So it goes.
Forgive and forget.
Everything happens for a reason.
It is what it is.
What the mind can conceive, it can achieve.
Winners never quit.
What doesnt you makes you stronger.
I dont want a team of champions, I want a champion team.
Teamwork makes the dream work.
Hard work always pays off.
God has a plan.
Great minds think alike.
Money cant buy happiness.
Live each moment like its your last.
